## <div align='center'>About</div>

<p align='center'>I am a multifaceted, intuitive, and detail-driven Full Stack Software Engineer <br/>whose work is inspired by creative collaboration, authentic expression, and effective organization.<br/>
<br/>
My past experience as an event professional and in the music industry has provided me with a diverse skill set to tackle any problem or project I encounter. It has trained me to be detail-oriented, precise, and intentional, while at the same time considering how my work may affect the customers, the rest of my team, and the project as a whole. <br/>
<br/>
Tech is the future, and I believe that as a software engineer I am able to directly and positively impact the lives of many people.</p>
